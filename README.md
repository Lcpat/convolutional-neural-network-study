# convolutional-neural-network-study
**Description:** A study in convolutional neural networks (CNN) using CIFAR-10 as a base model 

# !Note: WIP!
This repo currently in development 

**Goal:** Understand how configuration and training affect performance/generalization in artificial intelligence.  

**Method:** 
- Implement standard CNN (CIFAR-10) on a public dataset
- Reconfigure certain variables
- Compare outputs from pre and post reconfiguration
