<u>**!NOTE: WIP! THIS REPO IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT**</u>

**Description:** A study in convolutional neural networks (CNN) using CIFAR-10 as a base model 

**Goal:** Understand how configuration and training affect performance/generalization in artificial intelligence.  

**Method:** 
- Implement standard CNN (CIFAR-10) on a public dataset
- Reconfigure certain variables
- Compare outputs from pre and post reconfiguration
