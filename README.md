# convolutional-neural-network-study
> **NOTE: WIP; THIS REPO IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT**

### Description:
A study in convolutional neural networks (CNN) using CIFAR-10 as a base model 

### Goal:
Understand how configuration and training affect performance/generalization in artificial intelligence.  

### Method:
- Implement standard CNN (CIFAR-10) on a public dataset
- Reconfigure certain variables
- Compare outputs from pre and post reconfiguration

### Results:
TBD
